      <description>Introduction Albeit, this article falls outwards of my typical writing style, which normally includes abundant code blocks and programming know-how, but I thought I would give it a try nevertheless. (omg this sounds AI written already i promise its not)&#xA;The idea of AI being able to write it&amp;rsquo;s own social media posts, more specifically instructional posts such as tutorials and guides has plagued my brain from time to time for the past year.</description>

      <description>What is this? This is my first Hugo site, and the theme is powered by the amazingly clean and compact TopHat theme!&#xA;What can it do? Well, because this entire site was written in MarkDown, a very easy to use &amp;ldquo;programming language&amp;rdquo; changes can be made very easily! MarkDown supports the HTML basics, such as bold text, italicized text, headers, underlined text, etc. so I will attempt to use them in the section below!</description>
